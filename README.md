# AngularEcomm

Angular Ecomm app with cart functionality which totals the final cart value as we add products. 

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:
```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

- Currently trying to implement quantity feature for products.
